### 140 verses

In some way, we are trying to find art in chaos and randomness.

The inspiration for 140verses comes from the Infinite Monkey theorem. It states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.
140verses was inspired by a monkey for god's sake. And delusions that it would sit in front of a typewriter hitting keys.
